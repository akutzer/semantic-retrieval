# A couple things have to be done to make this work
- create venv with requirements.txt in this subfolder
- the import file .json and the output file .csv have to be defined in the threaded_question_generation_moreproviders.py main function to match the files of the preprocessed wikis
- run init_script notebook
- navigate to gpt4free folder and run the file threadedqg.py which is inside it
