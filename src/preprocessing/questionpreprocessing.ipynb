Black developed a unpleasant crusty covering on his hand due to direct exposure to the powder but was able to instantly heal himself with magic.\\nBehind the scenes.\\n originated in the Americas, being first recorded among the indigenous people of Brazil. The idea was brought to Europe by friar Ramón Pané, who had observed the practice on 's second voyage to the New World in 1493.

She also used it to cast the Summoning Charm to pull Ton-Tongue Toffees from Fred's and George Weasley's clothing, complaining that they had been told to destroy them all.\\nIn 1995, she used it to repair a piece of parchment onto which Nymphadora Tonks accidentally toppled a candle. She also made several meals including lunch and breakfast. She also use this wand in attempting to banish the boggart in the writing desk in the drawing room at 12 Grimmauld Place.\\nIn 1996 Molly used this wand to make onion soup for Harry Potter when he arrived early from his trip with Albus Dumbledore to recruit Horace Slughorn. She also used it in conjunction with \"The Healer's Helpmate\" to try and help Hermione Granger to lessen her resemblance to \"half a panda\" after she was hit in the eye by a Boxing telescope. On Christmas, she used this wand to increase the volume on the Wireless when listening to a broadcast by Celestina Warbeck.\\nIn 1997, Molly magicked the plates to serve apple tart. She also used it in trying to make bacon on the morning of Harry Potter's seventeenth birthday, but caused half of the pack to flop out from the frying pan onto the floor because of the emotion from Harry's hug after receiving her brother's watch. She also used it to levitate Harry's birthday cake which was shaped like a Golden Snitch.\\nMolly was been able to perform powerful magic with her wand, including being able to finish off and kill an incredibly powerful duellist and Dark witch, Bellatrix Lestrange, which she did in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998.</td>\n",

The runes themselves could be used both as an alphabet or as stand-in for whole words (as logograms). Runes appeared to be common in the Middle Ages.\\nRunes were widely used by the modern magical community, and were studied at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry under the subject \"Study of Ancient Runes\". Ancient runes were studied at Hogwarts in sixth year History of Magic classes during the 1989–1990 school year.\\nUses.\\nDuring the Early Middle Ages many famous wizards and witches (such as Merlin, the Peverell brothers and the founders of Hogwarts) very likely used runes to write in Old English. As such, runes were widely used by both the Early Medieval magical community as well as the Muggle community in Great Britain. Many ancient magical items like the Hogwarts Pensieve, and the Elder Wand, contained runic inscriptions.\\nMany texts in Old English were completely written using runes, for example, Albus Dumbledore's old version of , requiring translation before mass-production for the general public. The esoteric \"Quibbler\" magazine had been known to publish runic texts (including instructions for a spell to turn another's ears into kumquats).\\nRunes were still widely used for administration purposes by the Ministry of Magic in Great Britain. The teachers at Hogwarts had to provide their magic rune on an evaluation form given by Dolores Umbridge. There also was a magical rune of Alastor Moody's on the file in Umbridge's office in 1998, it is possible that these features were of particular importance, and served as a form of identification or a social security number.\\nKnown runes.\\nAlphabetical.\\nThe runes represented were used to write words in an alphabetic manner all belonged to the Old English runic alphabet (also known as Elder Futhark).\\nPersonal runes.\\nVarious wizards were known to have their own magic rune, that they used in a manner similar to a signature to sign documents or to indicate their possession of certain objects. Possibly these personal runes were either normal runes from the Elder Futhark alphabet that spelt out initials, or a composed symbol combining several runes into a new symbol. An example of such composed runes could be seen on the cover of the Rune Dictionary. It is also possible that these composed runes on the cover of the Rune Dictionary stood for whole words or often used expressions in texts.\\nNumerical.\\nTo represent the numbers, various magical creatures were used:</td>\n",

However, the act of slaying a unicorn would cause the drinker to suffer a cursed life, though the specifics of what this actually entailed were not well known. It was probably non-tradeable, since the sale of this substance was controlled by the British Ministry of Magic, making it strictly forbidden. Firenze and Harry Potter both believed that only those who had nothing to lose and everything to gain would dare drink unicorn blood.\\nUnicorn blood was an ingredient for a potion that creates a rudimentary body for a disembodied soul.\\nHistory.\\nIn 1992, Lord Voldemort used unicorn blood to sustain his life, until he could steal the Philosopher's Stone in order to regain his true body. As he was possessing Quirinus Quirrell and inhabiting his body at the time, Quirrell drank the blood on Voldemort's behalf. This was because Quirrell's body was dying as it is from sharing it with Voldemort's fragmented soul.\\nLate in the 1991–1992 school year, when Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom, and Draco Malfoy were caught out of bounds, they were punished with detention in the Forbidden Forest. At the edge of the forest, they joined Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, who told them that a unicorn had been injured and that they were to search for it. Prior to splitting up the group, Hagrid pointed out the unicorn blood on the ground.\\nIn 1994, Peter Pettigrew used unicorn blood along with Nagini's venom to create a potion which would create a temporary body for Voldemort, until he could regain his true body. It is unknown if producing such a potion and proceeding to use it (orally or otherwise) creates a similar curse upon the user's life. In Voldemort's case, his re-usage of unicorn blood (having indirectly consumed some two years prior) may have had a cumulative effect on the curse's potency. Voldemort's questionable degree of humanity, however, may have diluted, or even negated entirely, the efficacy of the curse.</td>\n",

According to Elphias Doge, people still say that no duel ever matched it.\\nHistory.\\nBackground information.\\nDecades before the legendary duel, Gellert Grindelwald had come to Godric's Hollow to stay with his great aunt, Bathilda Bagshot. He became friends with the seventeen year old Albus Dumbledore, and they both became obsessed with the powerful objects known as the Deathly Hallows. This trio comprised the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone, and the Cloak of Invisibility. \\nThe plans became more and more far-fetched. Albus's younger brother, Aberforth, intervened and pointed out the impossibilities of the scheme. Gellert quickly became enraged and the three began to duel. Ariana Dumbledore was killed in the process. This caused the end of Dumbledore and Grindelwald's friendship, and forced Grindelwald to flee, going on later to raise an Army in an attempt to continue his plan of wizarding domination.\\nGrindelwald soon tracked down the Elder Wand, stole it from Gregorovitch, and began to amass power. As his machinations played out over the next 45 years, he became one of the most powerful Dark Wizards in history, and a serious threat to the Wizarding World. Meanwhile, Dumbledore had become the Transfiguration Professor and Deputy Headmaster of Hogwarts, and gained a considerable reputation for his wisdom and achievements along the way.\\nAs Grindelwald gained power, public opinion grew that Albus Dumbledore would be the only one able to stop him. Dumbledore, still haunted by his history with the dark wizard, procrastinated. Unbenknowst to most, Dumbledore was actually unable to confront Grindelwald directly: in their youth, the two wizards had sworn a blood pact, sealed in magic, not to fight each other. The vial that had sealed the pact was kept by Grindelwald for years until it was stolen in 1927 by Newton Scamander. Dumbledore believed that it might be possible for him to destroy the blood pact when it was given to him by Newt, but seemed unsure on whether he would succeed.\\nIn 1932, Grindelwald tried to kill Credence Barebone at The Walk of the Qilin Ceremony for failing him. Albus and Aberforth Dumbledore intervened, and the blood pact between Grindelwald and Dumbledore was broken. He and Grindelwald immediately started duelling for the second time in another dimension until they reached a stalemate and separated.\\nThe duel.\\nBy 1945, the outcry against Grindelwald had become too vocal. Grindelwald's actions were far too horrible for Dumbledore to ignore, and on 2 November 1945, at dawn, he finally confronted his old friend. The duel was one of the most well-known duels in the world, and one of Dumbledore's most famous moments was with, Dumbledore winning the duel and the Elder Wand's allegiance. According to Elphias Doge, eye-witnesses speak of the terror and awe they felt as they watched the extraordinary Dumbledore and Grindelwald do battle, and proclaimed that no duel ever matched theirs.\\nAftermath.\\nGellert Grindelwald was captured and detained in the top-most cell of Nurmengard, a prison that he himself had constructed to hold his enemies. According to Elphias Doge, Dumbledore's triumph and its consequences for the Wizarding world were considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy, and the downfall of Lord Voldemort. Grindelwald remained there for the rest of his life until his death at the hands of the only Dark Wizard more powerful and dangerous than himself, Lord Voldemort, after refusing to give him information about the Elder Wand.\\nAlbus Dumbledore returned to his place in Hogwarts, and eventually became Headmaster until his death in 1997. His victory in this battle would be published on his Chocolate Frog Card and award him an Order of Merlin first class.</td>\n",

It was subsequently purchased by a Muggle woman who used it for a tea party, but the bewitched tea set caused it to end in disaster and several injuries; the teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea everywhere and one unfortunate man ended up hospitalised when the sugar tongs attacked him and clamped onto his nose. Arthur Weasley had quite a time sorting the whole thing out, as an employee for the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office.   \n",

Harry Potter received one of these at Christmas from Nymphadora Tonks on 25 December 1995. Harry missed his real Firebolt which he got back at the end of the year while watching it zoom around his bedroom at 12 Grimmauld Place during the Christmas holidays.   \n",

Points were granted for the snuffbox's prettiness, but points were deducted if the snuffboxes still had whiskers.\\nA snuffbox made of silver, filled with Wartcap powder, bit Sirius Black during the cleanup of Number 12 Grimmauld Place in August of 1995. Black developed a unpleasant crusty covering on his hand due to direct exposure to the powder but was able to instantly heal himself with magic.\\nBehind the scenes.\\n originated in the Americas, being first recorded among the indigenous people of Brazil. The idea was brought to Europe by friar Ramón Pané, who had observed the practice on 's second voyage to the New World in 1493. The use of snuff became extremely popular over the coming centuries, especially among the upper classes, and was in common use by the 17th century.    \n",

The one who owed the debt to the saviour would one day be obliged to repay the deed by doing something beneficial to the said saviour. Such a bond could be formed between even the worst of enemies and regardless of whether either of the involved parties wanted it or not. As this bond was magically binding, the indebted could commit the repayment without acknowledging it, or even against their will.   \n",

It most notably struck down and killed the Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange in 1998.\\nHistory.\\nLike most wizards and witches in Britain, she likely purchased it at the age of eleven before beginning her education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1961.\\nIn 1992, her wand was noted to have been kept in a pocket of her apron.\\nIn 1994, she used it several times to help prepare large meals, including making sauces and chopping potatoes, although she at one point accidentally grabbed one of her twin sons' trick wands instead of her own wand when she put it down for a second, much to her irritation. She also used it to cast the Summoning Charm to pull Ton-Tongue Toffees from Fred's and George Weasley's clothing, complaining that they had been told to destroy them all.\\nIn 1995, she used it to repair a piece of parchment onto which Nymphadora Tonks accidentally toppled a candle. She also made several meals including lunch and breakfast. She also use this wand in attempting to banish the boggart in the writing desk in the drawing room at 12 Grimmauld Place.\\nIn 1996 Molly used this wand to make onion soup for Harry Potter when he arrived early from his trip with Albus Dumbledore to recruit Horace Slughorn. She also used it in conjunction with \"The Healer's Helpmate\" to try and help Hermione Granger to lessen her resemblance to \"half a panda\" after she was hit in the eye by a Boxing telescope. On Christmas, she used this wand to increase the volume on the Wireless when listening to a broadcast by Celestina Warbeck.\\nIn 1997, Molly magicked the plates to serve apple tart. She also used it in trying to make bacon on the morning of Harry Potter's seventeenth birthday, but caused half of the pack to flop out from the frying pan onto the floor because of the emotion from Harry's hug after receiving her brother's watch. She also used it to levitate Harry's birthday cake which was shaped like a Golden Snitch.\\nMolly was been able to perform powerful magic with her wand, including being able to finish off and kill an incredibly powerful duellist and Dark witch, Bellatrix Lestrange, which she did in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998.   \n",

The runes themselves could be used both as an alphabet or as stand-in for whole words (as logograms). Runes appeared to be common in the Middle Ages.\\nRunes were widely used by the modern magical community, and were studied at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry under the subject \"Study of Ancient Runes\". Ancient runes were studied at Hogwarts in sixth year History of Magic classes during the 1989–1990 school year.\\nUses.\\nDuring the Early Middle Ages many famous wizards and witches (such as Merlin, the Peverell brothers and the founders of Hogwarts) very likely used runes to write in Old English. As such, runes were widely used by both the Early Medieval magical community as well as the Muggle community in Great Britain. Many ancient magical items like the Hogwarts Pensieve, and the Elder Wand, contained runic inscriptions.\\nMany texts in Old English were completely written using runes, for example, Albus Dumbledore's old version of , requiring translation before mass-production for the general public. The esoteric \"Quibbler\" magazine had been known to publish runic texts (including instructions for a spell to turn another's ears into kumquats).\\nRunes were still widely used for administration purposes by the Ministry of Magic in Great Britain. The teachers at Hogwarts had to provide their magic rune on an evaluation form given by Dolores Umbridge. There also was a magical rune of Alastor Moody's on the file in Umbridge's office in 1998, it is possible that these features were of particular importance, and served as a form of identification or a social security number.\\nKnown runes.\\nAlphabetical.\\nThe runes represented were used to write words in an alphabetic manner all belonged to the Old English runic alphabet (also known as Elder Futhark).\\nPersonal runes.\\nVarious wizards were known to have their own magic rune, that they used in a manner similar to a signature to sign documents or to indicate their possession of certain objects. Possibly these personal runes were either normal runes from the Elder Futhark alphabet that spelt out initials, or a composed symbol combining several runes into a new symbol.

She could also conjure at least a non-corporeal Patronus. She also wielded this wand during the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998.   \n",

Ronald Weasley once gagged on a kipper.\\nA Chaser of a Hogwarts Quidditch team usually ate kippers for breakfast before Quidditch matches.\\nKipper was sometimes served as part of regular meals. In February 1995, after Hermione Granger aggravated the Hogwarts house-elves, Ronald Weasley worried that it would put them off their cooking, but the next morning \"the bacon, eggs, and kippers were quite as good as usual.\"\\nWhen Ron caught sight of his brother Percy on the morning of the Funeral of Albus Dumbledore, he stabbed some pieces of kipper with unwonted venom.   \n",

The colour of the wine itself was blood-red, and was known to be sold as a bottled good.\\nHistory.\\nSeverus Snape was known to have owned a bottle (or more) of elf-made wine in the summer of 1996, as he ordered his \"assistant\" Peter Pettigrew to bring some for his visitors: Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy when they visited his home in Spinner's End. The bottle seemed rather dusty, as Snape had left them there for long period of time unattended.\\nPettigrew dropped them onto the rickety table rather in a dissatisfied manner due to the lack of respect he received before leaving. They drank the first cups, toasting to the Dark Lord, and Snape had to force some more on Narcissa to calm her anxiety.\\nLater that year, Rubeus Hagrid and Horace Slughorn drank some wine as a way of respecting Aragog's death, with the latter having house-elves test his drink having seen Ronald Weasley drink mead tainted with poison earlier that day. Harry Potter refilled the bottles of wine with the Refilling Charm in order to get Horace drunk, making it easier to get a memory out of him.   \n",

However, the act of slaying a unicorn would cause the drinker to suffer a cursed life, though the specifics of what this actually entailed were not well known. It was probably non-tradeable, since the sale of this substance was controlled by the British Ministry of Magic, making it strictly forbidden. Firenze and Harry Potter both believed that only those who had nothing to lose and everything to gain would dare drink unicorn blood.\\nUnicorn blood was an ingredient for a potion that creates a rudimentary body for a disembodied soul.\\nHistory.\\nIn 1992, Lord Voldemort used unicorn blood to sustain his life, until he could steal the Philosopher's Stone in order to regain his true body. As he was possessing Quirinus Quirrell and inhabiting his body at the time, Quirrell drank the blood on Voldemort's behalf. This was because Quirrell's body was dying as it is from sharing it with Voldemort's fragmented soul.\\nLate in the 1991–1992 school year, when Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom, and Draco Malfoy were caught out of bounds, they were punished with detention in the Forbidden Forest. At the edge of the forest, they joined Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, who told them that a unicorn had been injured and that they were to search for it. Prior to splitting up the group, Hagrid pointed out the unicorn blood on the ground.\\nIn 1994, Peter Pettigrew used unicorn blood along with Nagini's venom to create a potion which would create a temporary body for Voldemort, until he could regain his true body. It is unknown if producing such a potion and proceeding to use it (orally or otherwise) creates a similar curse upon the user's life. In Voldemort's case, his re-usage of unicorn blood (having indirectly consumed some two years prior) may have had a cumulative effect on the curse's potency. Voldemort's questionable degree of humanity, however, may have diluted, or even negated entirely, the efficacy of the curse.   \n",

As dragon hide was very tough, as well as being resistant to spells, these types of gloves were exceptionally useful in protecting the wearer from a multitude of dangers, such as burning or being bitten.\\nHistory.\\nDragon hide gloves, or similar protective gloves were required as part of the Hogwarts uniform.\\nDuring a lesson in which Rubeus Hagrid had his fourth-year Care of Magical Creatures students take the Blast-Ended Skrewts for a walk in 1994, he advised that they might to put on their dragon-hide gloves as an added precaution.\\nIn late 1995 at Hogwarts, when the weather become colder and the Castle's tempreature dropped significantly, many students wore their dragon hide gloves for warmth in between lessons in corridors.\\nThese gloves were also highly useful and practical for Herbology, particularly with the handling and cultivating of various dangerous plants.\\nThese gloves could be purchased at Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions for three Galleons and eleven Sickles in 1991.   \n",

It was enchanted by Godric Gryffindor to turn into a slide should any boy attempt to enter it.\\nHistory.\\nBack in the era of the Hogwarts founders, a common belief was that girls were more trustworthy than boys, and as such, Godric Gryffindor enchanted the girls' staircase to turn into a slide should a boy set foot upon it, but not vice versa.\\nDuring the 1995–1996 school year, the staircase turned on Ron Weasley and Harry Potter, who had been trying enter the girls dormitory to contact Hermione Granger. The stairs turned into the magnificent slide and Ron fell. Hermione herself came down moments later, following a pair of laughing girls.   \n",

An hour before the play started, he dumped the girl playing Amata in favour of the one playing Asha, causing the two jealous young witches to duel each other on the stage.

       "39  This final duel between Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald took place on 2 November 1945, before Dumbledore's ascension to the position of Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and ended the global wizarding war. According to Elphias Doge, people still say that no duel ever matched it.\\nHistory.\\nBackground information.\\nDecades before the legendary duel, Gellert Grindelwald had come to Godric's Hollow to stay with his great aunt, Bathilda Bagshot. He became friends with the seventeen year old Albus Dumbledore, and they both became obsessed with the powerful objects known as the Deathly Hallows. This trio comprised the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone, and the Cloak of Invisibility. \\nThe plans became more and more far-fetched. Albus's younger brother, Aberforth, intervened and pointed out the impossibilities of the scheme. Gellert quickly became enraged and the three began to duel. Ariana Dumbledore was killed in the process. This caused the end of Dumbledore and Grindelwald's friendship, and forced Grindelwald to flee, going on later to raise an Army in an attempt to continue his plan of wizarding domination.\\nGrindelwald soon tracked down the Elder Wand, stole it from Gregorovitch, and began to amass power. As his machinations played out over the next 45 years, he became one of the most powerful Dark Wizards in history, and a serious threat to the Wizarding World. Meanwhile, Dumbledore had become the Transfiguration Professor and Deputy Headmaster of Hogwarts, and gained a considerable reputation for his wisdom and achievements along the way.\\nAs Grindelwald gained power, public opinion grew that Albus Dumbledore would be the only one able to stop him. Dumbledore, still haunted by his history with the dark wizard, procrastinated. Unbenknowst to most, Dumbledore was actually unable to confront Grindelwald directly: in their youth, the two wizards had sworn a blood pact, sealed in magic, not to fight each other. The vial that had sealed the pact was kept by Grindelwald for years until it was stolen in 1927 by Newton Scamander. Dumbledore believed that it might be possible for him to destroy the blood pact when it was given to him by Newt, but seemed unsure on whether he would succeed.\\nIn 1932, Grindelwald tried to kill Credence Barebone at The Walk of the Qilin Ceremony for failing him. Albus and Aberforth Dumbledore intervened, and the blood pact between Grindelwald and Dumbledore was broken. He and Grindelwald immediately started duelling for the second time in another dimension until they reached a stalemate and separated.\\nThe duel.\\nBy 1945, the outcry against Grindelwald had become too vocal. Grindelwald's actions were far too horrible for Dumbledore to ignore, and on 2 November 1945, at dawn, he finally confronted his old friend. The duel was one of the most well-known duels in the world, and one of Dumbledore's most famous moments was with, Dumbledore winning the duel and the Elder Wand's allegiance. According to Elphias Doge, eye-witnesses speak of the terror and awe they felt as they watched the extraordinary Dumbledore and Grindelwald do battle, and proclaimed that no duel ever matched theirs.\\nAftermath.\\nGellert Grindelwald was captured and detained in the top-most cell of Nurmengard, a prison that he himself had constructed to hold his enemies. According to Elphias Doge, Dumbledore's triumph and its consequences for the Wizarding world were considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy, and the downfall of Lord Voldemort. Grindelwald remained there for the rest of his life until his death at the hands of the only Dark Wizard more powerful and dangerous than himself, Lord Voldemort, after refusing to give him information about the Elder Wand.\\nAlbus Dumbledore returned to his place in Hogwarts, and eventually became Headmaster until his death in 1997.
